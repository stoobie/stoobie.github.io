<h1>Steve's Pizza</h1>
<p>Edwardo's, Gino's East, Mama Leona's, Barnaby's...</p>
<p>Pizza in Chicago.</p>
<p>Thin crust, thick crust, stuffed...cut in squares or triangles</p>
<p>Crispy, light, gobble it up, or gobs and gobs of cheese, so much that it drips from your mouth onto the slice still on your plate</p>
<p>Mushrooms, spinach, onions, garlic, pesto and red sauce with chunks of tomato.</p>
<p>Ready in 15 minutes, or ready in an hourâ€”but so worth the wait.</p>

<p>Of all the different kinds of pizza I remember, I have not recollection of any <a href="how2makepbjpizza.html">peanut butter and jelly pizza</a>.</p>
<p>Now isn't that sad?</p>
